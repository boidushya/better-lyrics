## FAQ

### Why are the lyrics not showing up?

Make sure that the extension is enabled and that you are on <https://music.youtube.com>. The extension won't work on the regular YouTube website.

### How do I change settings?

Click on the Better Lyrics icon in the extensions toolbar to access the settings. The changes are applied immediately and don't require a page refresh. However, in some cases, for example, updating the extension, you might need to refresh the page to toggle settings/add or update CSS.

### My CSS changes are not showing up. What do I do?

If you've made changes to the CSS and they're not showing up, try refreshing the page, especially after updating the extension. Your CSS changes will be saved regardless. If that doesn't work, try disabling and re-enabling the extension.

### How do I turn on full-screen mode?

Press F on your keyboard (with the window in focus) or hover over the album art and press the full-screen icon (‚õ∂). Make sure that the "Disable fullscreen mode" option is not checked in the extension settings.

### How do I translate lyrics?

Enable the "Translations" option in the extension settings and select the desired language from the dropdown.

### Can I contribute to Better Lyrics?

Yes you can! Please follow the contributing guidelines below.

### Some lyrics are out of sync/missing/incorrect. What can I do?

If you find any issues with lyrics, you now have two options:

1. Switch to a different lyrics provider in the extension settings to see if the lyrics are better there
2. Contribute your own lyrics using our new LRCLib upload tool at [https://lrclibup.boidu.dev](https://lrclibup.boidu.dev)

The LRCLib upload tool allows you to submit correct, properly synchronized lyrics that will be available to all users who use the LRCLib provider. This is a community-driven approach to improving lyrics quality.

### How do I contribute lyrics?

You can now contribute lyrics using our new LRCLib upload tool:

1. Visit [https://lrclibup.boidu.dev](https://lrclibup.boidu.dev)
2. Follow the tool's interface to upload and synchronize lyrics
3. Submit your contribution

This helps improve the lyrics database for all Better Lyrics users who use the LRCLib provider.

### How do I report a bug?

Please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boidushya/better-lyrics/issues/new/choose) with as much detail as possible. Alternatively, you can join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/UsHE3d5fWF) and report it there under the `#bug-reports` channel.

### I don't like the new update. Can I revert to the old version?

Yes, you can! Please follow the manual installation instructions above to install the old version of the extension. However, please note that the old version will most likely not be maintained or have the latest features.

### How do I support the project?

Better Lyrics is a free and open-source project. The easiest way to support the project is by leaving a positive feedback on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-lyrics/effdbpeggelllpfkjppbokhmmiinhlmg), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-lyrics/), or [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/better-lyrics-lyrics-for/mjfeaklppoegooljmjicjdbiccgjdlhd) so that more people can discover it.
If you want to support the project further, please consider making a donation to help cover the costs of hosting and development. You can donate via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/boidushya).

### Do you plan on pay-walling the extension in the future?

No, I have no plans to pay-wall the extension. Better Lyrics will always be free and open-source for everyone to use.

### I want to use Better Lyrics along with another extension. Is that possible?

Yes, Better Lyrics should work with most extensions. However, if you encounter any issues, please report them under the `#bug-reports` channel in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/UsHE3d5fWF) or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boidushya/better-lyrics/issues/new/choose).

### Can I use Better Lyrics on mobile?

Better Lyrics is currently only available for desktop browsers. However, if you use a browser that supports extensions on mobile (such as Kiwi Browser on Android), you might be able to use it on mobile as well since the extension is responsive.

### Can I use a different lyrics provider?

Yes! Better Lyrics now supports switching between different lyrics providers. You can change your provider in the extension settings:

1. Click on the Better Lyrics icon in the extensions toolbar
2. Go to "General" settings
3. Under "Default Lyrics Provider", you can choose between:
   - Better Lyrics (default)
   - LRCLib

However, right now, adding a custom lyrics provider is not supported.

### Can I use Better Lyrics on other browsers?

Right now, Better Lyrics is only available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers like Brave, Opera, Arc, etc.). If there is enough demand, I might consider porting it to other browsers as well.

### Lyrics have stopped showing up completely for all songs. What do I do?

First, make sure that this issue is not caused by the backend server being down. You can check the status of the backend server [here](https://better-lyrics-status.boidu.dev). This page will show you the current status of the server and any incidents that might be affecting the service by checking every 30 minutes. While it's rare, there might be times when the server is down for maintenance or due to an incident and this page hasn't updated yet. In that case

- Check the extension logs/networks tab for any errors.
- Check [Railway's status page](https://status.railway.app/) for any incidents that might be affecting the service hosting the backend.
- If you're unsure, reaching out to me (@boidu) on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/UsHE3d5fWF) is the fastest way to get help. I'm usually active and can help you figure out if the issue is on your end or mine.

If the server is up and you're still facing issues, try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, try disabling and re-enabling the extension/updating the extension to the latest version. If everything fails, report the issue under the `#bug-reports` channel in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/UsHE3d5fWF) or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boidushya/better-lyrics/issues/new/choose).

### Can I use Better Lyrics on other music streaming services?

No, Better Lyrics is specifically designed for YouTube Music. If you want something similar for other music streaming services, consider using other extensions - some of which are mentioned below. If you have suggestions for similar extensions for other services, please open a PR to add them to this list.
