## FAQ

### Why can't I see the lyrics?

Make sure the extension is enabled and you're on <https://music.youtube.com>. The extension won't work on <https://youtube.com>.

### How do I change settings?

Click the Better Lyrics icon in your extensions toolbar to access settings. Changes apply immediately without needing to refresh the page. However, in some cases, for example, after updating the extension, you might need to refresh for settings or CSS updates to take effect.

### My CSS changes aren't showing up. What should I do?

Try refreshing the page, especially if you recently updated the extension. Your CSS changes are saved either way. If that doesn't work, try disabling and re-enabling the extension.

### How do I enable full-screen mode?

Press F on your keyboard (with the window in focus) or hover over the player bar and click the full-screen icon (‚õ∂). Make sure "Disable fullscreen mode" option isn't checked in extension settings.

### How do I translate lyrics?

Enable the "Translations" option in extension settings and select your desired language from the dropdown.

### Can I contribute to Better Lyrics?

Yes you can! Please follow the contributing guidelines below.

### Some lyrics are out of sync, missing, or incorrect. What can I do?

If you find any issues with lyrics, you now have two options:

1. Toggle or reorder providers in extension settings
2. Contribute your own lyrics using [LRCLIBup](https://lrclibup.boidu.dev)

LRCLIBup allows you to submit correct, properly synchronized lyrics that will be available to all users who use the LRCLib provider. This is a community-driven approach to improving and adding lyrics, so please be mindful of quality.

This helps improve the lyrics database for all Better Lyrics users who use the LRCLib provider.

### How do I report a bug?

[Open an issue here](https://github.com/boidushya/better-lyrics/issues/new/choose) with as much detail as possible. Alternatively, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/UsHE3d5fWF) and report it under `#bug-reports`.

### I don't like the new update. Can I revert to an old version?

Yes! Follow the manual installation instructions above to install an older version of the extension. Keep in mind that older versions probably won't be maintained or get new features.

### How do I support the project?

Better Lyrics is free and open-source. The easiest way to support it is by leaving positive feedback on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-lyrics/effdbpeggelllpfkjppbokhmmiinhlmg), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-lyrics/), or [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/better-lyrics-lyrics-for/mjfeaklppoegooljmjicjdbiccgjdlhd) so more people can discover it.

If you want to support the project further, consider making a donation to help cover hosting and development costs. You can donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/boidushya).

### Will this extension ever be paywalled?

No. Better Lyrics will always be free and open-source for everyone.

### Can I use Better Lyrics on mobile?

Better Lyrics is currently only available for desktop browsers. However, if you use a browser that supports extensions on mobile (such as Kiwi Browser on Android), you should be able to use it since the extension is responsive and has feature parity across platforms.

### Can I use a different lyrics provider?

Yes! Better Lyrics supports switching between different providers. You can reorder or toggle providers via extension settings:

1. Click the Better Lyrics icon in the extensions toolbar
2. Go to "Sources" tab
3. Reorder or toggle providers as per your needs

Adding custom providers isn't currently supported.

### Can I use Better Lyrics on other browsers?

Right now, Better Lyrics is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers like Brave, Opera, Arc, etc.). If there's enough demand, I might consider porting it to other browsers.

### Can I use Better Lyrics on other music streaming services?

No, Better Lyrics is specifically designed for YouTube Music. If you want something similar for other streaming services, check out these extensions. If you have suggestions for others, open a PR to add them to this list:
